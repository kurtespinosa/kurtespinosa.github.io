<div class="lead lead-about">My research interest lies at the intersection of machine learning and natural language processing. I am largely motivated by the challenge of how machines can learn to read and understand textual data.

 All the time we use terms (i.e. words or phrases) to illustrate concepts and communicate our ideas. How can we teach the computers to learn the meaning of these terms? Are there algorithms to learn the different terms of the same concept across domains? These are some of the questions I would like to answer in my research. Understanding this will have an impact in natural language understanding, summarisation, question-answering, etc.

Here is my [CV]().
