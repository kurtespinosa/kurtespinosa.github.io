title: Frontiers of Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning
desc: Some things that I learned during the Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning Summer School at MILA, Montreal
---

First of all, this post would not claim to exhaustively narrate everything discussed during the summer school. There are [slides] (https://mila.umontreal.ca/en/cours/deep-learning-summer-school-2017/schedule/) and [video lectures] (http://videolectures.net/site/search/?q=deep+learning+summer+school) for that and I highly recommend that you go thru them. Rather, in this post I will just mention ideas that are either: 1) new to me, 2) old but gain new perspective and deeper understanding 3) plain interesting. 





To all the organisers of the summer school, I could not thank you more. The summer school has opened to me the vast horizon of research frontiers in this field.
