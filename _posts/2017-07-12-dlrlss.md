title: Frontiers of Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning
desc: Some things that I learned during the Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning Summer School at MILA, Montreal

First of all, this post will not claim to exhaustively narrate everything discussed during the summer school. There are slides and video lectures for that and I highly recommend that you go thru them. Rather, in this post I will just mention ideas that either 1) new to me, 2) old but gain new perspective and deeper understanding 3) plain interesting. 



To all the organisers of the summer school, I could not thank you more. The summer school has opened to me the vast horizon of research frontiers in this field.
