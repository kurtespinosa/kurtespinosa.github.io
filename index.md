  Hi, my name is [Kurt Espinosa](about/) and I am a PhD student at the <a href="http://www.nactem.ac.uk">National Centre for Text Mining</a> at the <a href="http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk">University of Manchester</a>. My supervisors are <a href="http://www.nactem.ac.uk/staff/sophia.ananiadou/">Sophia Ananiadou</a> and <a href="http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/riza.batista/default.htm"> Riza Batista-Navarro</a>.

  I dream that computers will one day be able to read text and capture what it means just as humans do. For that to happen, computers must be able to represent concepts, which is the core of my [research](research/). In my spare time, I immerse myself in small but fun [projects](projects/) or [write](blog/) about interesting topics.

  If you have any questions about my research or projects, feel free to contact me.
