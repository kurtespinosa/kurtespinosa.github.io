  Hi, my name is [Kurt Espinosa](about/) and I am a PhD student at the <a href="http://www.nactem.ac.uk">National Centre for Text Mining</a> at the <a href="http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk">University of Manchester</a>. My supervisors are <a href="http://www.nactem.ac.uk/staff/sophia.ananiadou/">Sophia Ananiadou</a> and <a href="http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/riza.batista/default.htm"> Riza Batista-Navarro</a>.

  I dream that computers will one day be able to read and understand text just like you do. I believe that will be possible if computers can learn to represent concepts, which is the core of my [research](research/). 

  In my spare time, I enjoy creating small and fun [projects](projects/) or [writing](blog/) about wild and fascinating ideas. Feel free to contact me.
