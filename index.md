  Hi, my name is [Kurt Espinosa](about/). I am a PhD student at the <a href="http://www.nactem.ac.uk" target="_blank">National Centre for Text Mining</a> of the University of Manchester. My supervisors are <a href="http://www.nactem.ac.uk/staff/sophia.ananiadou/" target="_blank">Sophia Ananiadou</a> and <a href="http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/riza.batista/default.htm" target="_blank"> Riza Batista-Navarro</a>.

  I dream that one day computers will be able to *read* and *understand* text just like we do. I believe that is possible only if computers can learn to *represent* concepts, which is primarily the core of my [research](research/). 

  In my spare time, I enjoy creating small and fun [projects](projects/) or [writing](blog/) about ideas that fascinate me. If you share any of my interests, feel free to <a href="mailto:kurtjunshean.espinosa@postgrad.manchester.ac.uk">contact me</a>.
